# GNNLQN
Random_LQN_Generator: Matlab script to generate random LQN as user-defined numbers of processor, tasks, entries and calls.

Data_Loader: read .mat file generated by Random_LQN_Generator, build a HeteroData graph and data-prepocessing for training.

GLQNS: a customised message-passing framework for solving LQN

GLQNS_SAGEConv_based: a customised message-passing framework for solving LQN but for every layer this model use SAGEConv.

GLQNS_SAGEConv_edge: similar to GLQNS_SAGEConv_based but use different edge attributions processing method.
